# Frontend Modernization Plan

## Information Gathered
- **Theme (theme/index.ts)**: Already uses MUI with indigo-cyan palette, glassmorphism effects (backdropFilter, borders), but can be enhanced with more futuristic gradients, better shadows, and micro-animations.
- **Global Styles (index.css)**: Has radial gradients for background, custom scrollbar. Can be upgraded with more dynamic gradients and subtle animations.
- **App.css**: Basic styles, can be modernized with better layout and animations.
- **Components**: Header, Sidebar, Dashboard, Login, StockManagement, etc., use MUI components that inherit from theme. No structural changes needed, only style enhancements via theme overrides and component-specific styles.
- **Palette Goal**: Futuristic indigo-cyan-blue with smooth gradients, glassmorphism (blur, transparency), micro-animations, responsive design.

## Plan
1. **Update Theme (theme/index.ts)**:
   - Enhance color palette with deeper indigo-cyan-blue tones and gradients.
   - Improve glassmorphism: stronger backdrop blur, better borders, subtle shadows.
   - Add micro-animations: hover effects, transitions for buttons, cards.
   - Update typography for more modern feel (e.g., better font weights, spacing).
   - Ensure responsive design with better breakpoints.

2. **Update Global Styles (index.css)**:
   - Enhance background with more complex gradients and subtle animations (e.g., slow-moving gradients).
   - Improve scrollbar and add body animations.

3. **Update App.css**:
   - Add modern layout styles, animations for app container.

4. **Component-Specific Enhancements** (if needed, via theme overrides or inline styles):
   - Header: Add gradient backgrounds, animated icons.
   - Sidebar: Glassmorphism panels, hover animations.
   - Dashboard: Animated stat cards, gradient texts.
   - Login: Enhanced gradient background, animated elements.
   - StockManagement: Better table styling with animations.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- frontend/katana-web/src/theme/index.ts
- frontend/katana-web/src/index.css
- frontend/katana-web/src/App.css
- (Possibly component files if theme overrides aren't sufficient)

## Followup Steps
- Test responsiveness on different screen sizes.
- Verify animations work smoothly.
- Run the app to ensure no breaking changes.
- If needed, add more component-specific styles.
