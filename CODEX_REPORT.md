# Codex Work Summary

- **Date:** 2025-03-12
- **Agent:** Codex (GPT-5)

## Overview
- Hardened admin authentication by enforcing JWT validation on the frontend and securing admin/analytics/debug API controllers server-side.
- Improved pending stock adjustment workflow to return accurate error messages, persist failure reasons, and surface them in the UI with toasts.
- Added shared JWT utility helpers and wired the global feedback provider so admin actions surface success/error notifications.
- Updated pending adjustment approval logic to guard against missing products and prevent silent successes.

## Key Changes
- Added `frontend/katana-web/src/utils/jwt.ts` for safe JWT decoding, expiry checks, and claim extraction.
- Updated `ProtectedRoute` and Axios setup to use the new helpers, removing expired/malformed tokens proactively.
- Enhanced `PendingAdjustments` UI with toast feedback, better loading/error handling, actor resolution from JWT, and disabled actions for non-pending rows.
- Wrapped the app in `FeedbackProvider` to enable global notifications.
- Switched admin-related API controllers to `[Authorize]` and improved approval/rejection responses with detailed errors.
- Strengthened `PendingStockAdjustmentService.ApproveAsync` to record failure reasons and avoid reporting success when updates fail.

## Validation
- `dotnet build Katana.Integration.sln`
