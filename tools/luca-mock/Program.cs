// Mock server removed
// This file previously contained a lightweight mock Luca server used for local testing.
// The mock has been removed per request. Keep this file as a marker so tools don't
// attempt to run the mock accidentally. If you need the mock again, re-create it
// under `tools/luca-mock/` or restore from version control history.

// NOTE: If you want to delete this folder entirely, you can remove the remaining
// files: `Luca.Mock.csproj`, `mock.log`, `mock.err`, and the `bin/`/`obj/` folders.
